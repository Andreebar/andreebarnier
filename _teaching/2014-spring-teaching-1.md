The PeiP (Parcours des écoles d’ingénieurs Polytech) is a preparatory course aimed at preparing students for the Polytech engineering cycle by giving them a multidisciplinary fundamental scientific training supplemented by teaching geared towards the engineering profession (specific modules, projects, internships, etc.). This course offers a common base of scientific skills (mathematics, physics-chemistry, computer science, etc.) and transversal skills (English, communication, knowledge, business), supplemented by local specificities. Over the two years, each student validates professional experience (internship, seasonal work, etc.). Validation of the PeiP gives direct access to the engineering cycle under student status in one of the specialties of the 15 schools of the Polytech network.
