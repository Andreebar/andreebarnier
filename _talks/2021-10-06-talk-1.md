The Young Probabilists and Statisticians conference has been held every two years since 1994 under the aegis of the Random and Statistical Modeling (MAS) group of the Society of Applied and Industrial Mathematics (SMAI). Participants are advanced doctoral students (2nd or 3rd year) or possibly having defended their thesis during the year. Its aim is to provide them with a pleasant and informal setting to meet, present their work and enrich their thematic spectrum.
